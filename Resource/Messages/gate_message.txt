{c:blood}If you're reading this, 
I'm gone.
#
{c:blood}Only one person can reside
in The Catacombs at a time.
#
{c:blood}When one person enters, time
freezes from the moment they entered.
#
{c:blood}The pocket of time I live in
was destroyed the moment you entered.
#
{c:blood}I guess that makes this message
my tombstone.
#
{c:blood}To whoever came in after me:
Find the Crystals and end this cycle!
