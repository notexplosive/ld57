If you double-click `LD57.app`, macOS will tell you the app is "damaged" -- it's not! I promise!

This is a security measure on Apple's part, any software that isn't certified by Apple 
(a process that involves developers paying Apple every year) is considered "broken" and/or "unsafe".

To run the game on macOS you need to do the following:

1. Right click `LD57.app`
2. Select `New Terminal At Folder` in the context menu
3. This will open a terminal, type the following command:

xattr -cr .

4. You may now close the Terminal
5. Double click `LD57.app` -- it should now work!

Thank you for checking out LD57! I hope you enjoy it!
